# Processing Data in Cloud Computing - project

Final project from the title course. The theme was about Steven Universe cartoon. 

## Technologies
- Neo4 AuraDB graph database
- Cypher Query Language
- Python with libraries: Flask, FlaskForms, neo4j
- HTML
- Bootstrap

## Graph Database
Types of nodes created:
- ``Character`` - with **name** attribute
- ``Episode`` - with **name**, **number** (number in season), **season**, **overall** (number overall)
- ``Group`` - with **name** attribute (group of characters in the show)
- ``Writer`` - with **name** (writer of the episode)

Between those nodes are relations, presented on diagram below.

Here's a view of node types, their count and all of the nodes in database. Unfortunately, I might have lost the access to it at this point.
